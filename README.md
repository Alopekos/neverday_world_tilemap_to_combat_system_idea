# 🟦 Adaptable combat grid for a TileMapLayer 🟦

Hey! This little project is a **dynamic grid of tiles** that adapts to a 2D Godot environment depending on the camera which I'm certainly gonna use for Neverday.  
It checks if a tile exists and isn’t blocked by collisions.  
For now it spawns a fake visual `tile_grid` 🔳 but could easily be expanded into a combat or pathfinding system.

Don't ask about Neverday when though :

( or Neverday where or Neverday ever or Never Neverday Ever Neverday or Ever Never )

## 🎮 How to Test It

- git clone this repo  
- Launch Godot (made with **Godot 4.6**)  
- Move and zoom the camera around, add collisions, and enjoy! 🚀
